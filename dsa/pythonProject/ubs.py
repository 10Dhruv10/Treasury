# Top 10 High-Frequency UBS DSA Questions
# Merge Two Sorted Arrays
#
# Problem1: Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array (e.g., [1,3,5] + [2,4,6] → [1,2,3,4,5,6]).
#
# Key Skills: Two-pointers, in-place merging.
#
# Source: Common in UBS OAs 68.
#
# Find Missing Number in Natural Numbers
#
# Problem2: Given an array of natural numbers from 1 to n with one missing, find the missing number.
#
# Approach: Sum formula n(n+1)/2 or XOR optimization.
#
# Source: Repeatedly asked in technical rounds 8.
#
# Minimum Fountains to Cover Garden
#
# Problem3: "Count minimum number of fountains to be activated to cover the entire garden" GeeksforGeeks.
#
# Solution: Greedy interval covering.
#
# Source: Directly asked in technical interviews 5.
#
# Decimal Equivalent of Binary Linked List
#
# Problem4: Convert a binary number represented as a linked list to its decimal equivalent (e.g., 1 → 0 → 1 → 0 = 10).
#
# Approach: Traverse list while accumulating values.
#
# Source: UBS onsite interview question 5.
#
# Palindrome String Check
#
# Problem5: Check if a string is a palindrome (e.g., "racecar").
#
# Follow-up: Optimize for space/time, handle edge cases (case sensitivity, special characters).
#
# Source: Technical screening staple 6.
#
# Middle Node of Linked List
#
# Problem6: Find the middle node of a linked list (e.g., 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → middle is 3).
#
# Solution: Fast-slow pointer technique.
#
# Source: Common in UBS interviews 612.
#
# Height of Binary Tree
#
# Problem7: Compute the longest path from root to leaf.
#
# Approach: Recursive DFS.
#
# Source: Frequently tested 6.
#

# Solved
# Course Dependency Resolution
#
# Problem8: Given course prerequisites (e.g., A → B, C), list courses that can be taken without deadlocks (e.g., B, D).
#
# Solution: Topological sorting or DFS for cycle detection.
#
# Source: Advanced graph question in UBS interviews 12.


# Binary Tree LCA (Parent Pointer Only)
#
# Problem9: Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree where nodes only have parent pointers (no left/right).
#
# Approach: Trace paths to root and find intersection.
#
# Source: Asked in technical rounds 12.
#
# Repeated Numbers in Array (1 to N)
#
# Problem10: Identify duplicates in an array of size n containing numbers 1 to n.
#
# Optimization: Use negation marking or Floyd's cycle detection.
#
# Source: OA question variant 12.
